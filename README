# JarLauncher
## A small batch program I made so it's easier to launch .jar files.
- I was tired of opening the command prompt and typing it in, so I made the command prompt type it in. And unlike JarFix, you can open portable java installations!
## How do you use this?
- Get the path of your .javaw file (for me: "C:\Users\[my name]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.4297127D64EC6_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Local\runtime\jre-legacy\windows-x64\jre-legacy\bin\java.exe")
- Get the path of your .jar file
- Paste them both in
- It's now opened!
## Is there a way to skip the process of adding in my .javaw path?
- Open the .bat file
- Remove the "/p" in the first variable

- Replace the text after the equal sign with your path in quotation marks (there's gonna be 2 quotation marks, but that's normal (and nessecary!))

- You have now removed one of the steps!
